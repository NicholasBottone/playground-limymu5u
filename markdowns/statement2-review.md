# Time for a quiz!

Now we are going to do a quick review of the things that we just learned in the introductory lesson.  Answer the quiz questions to the best of your ability, but don't be afraid if you get one wrong, you can always try again.

If the first line of your code reads `public class Racecar`...
?[What is the name of your Java code?]
-[ ] public
-[x] Racecar
-[ ] class
-[ ] null

?[Which is the proper way to define a main method?]
-[ ] public String main(args)
-[ ] static void method()
-[ ] static String[] method(String[] args)
-[x] public static void main(String[] args)

?[How should you end every line that calls a method in Java?]
-[ ] By using a period (.)
-[ ] By using a curly bracket (})
-[x] By using a semicolon (;)
-[ ] By using a quotation mark (")

Congratulations, you have completed the first quiz review!  That wasn't too hard, was it?  Next will be your first project.  Using the basic skills that we just learned and reviewed, you'll be creating your very own Hello World Java program by yourself.  Move on to the next page once you are ready.
