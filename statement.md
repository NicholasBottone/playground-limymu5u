# Welcome to this introductory Java course!

This playground will help you get started quickly and jump into the wonderous world of Java programming.
By the end of this course, you'll learn the basics of Java programming, including how to use variables, loops, and objects.  You'll even create your own basic games in this introductory class.

This Java playground was designed for Java beginners by Nicholas Bottone representing FRC Team 5112 The Gongoliers.  Check out The Gongoliers at www.thegongoliers.com.
